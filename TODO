- We use \emph{d} and \emph{o} in the capabilities section. Maybe add a figure that shows them in use
  (a table?).
- Microkernels section too big, design section too small.
- Nutshell not a good reference when citing protocol information (use the specification itself maybe?)
- Show and explain the USB protocol rather than hardware bits (see example of TCP protocol definition or
  others in RFC).
